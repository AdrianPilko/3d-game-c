I've been following the tutorial in 3DSage's video on creating a 3d game renderer like Id software's Doom - basically trying to recreate it.
So far draws front and back surfaces in correct order using the painter algorithm, and to the top and bottom surfaces. You can pan and move around the world and move the viewing angle up and down. The only thing we do is draw verticals lines using a pixel plot from OpenGL.
